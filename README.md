## Improvements

* The logic within the ProcessParcel function can be abstracted away into the Parcel class itself or a sepaerate class called ParcelInformation
* Constants can be intoduced as the code is using alot of magic numbers
* Possibly look at expanding into an event driven architecture where every parcel calculation aggregates so that reciept string building and total calculation can be calculated separately  
* Slighty procedural, with more time I would think about the object & types needed for better structure to the code
